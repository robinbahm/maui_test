# maui_test Repository

This repository hosts **DishLaundry**, a sample cross-platform dating app built with .NET MAUI. It demonstrates how a Tinder-style experience could be structured across Android, iOS, macOS and Windows.

> **Note**: The app in this repo is a learning example only. Networking, persistent storage and many real-world features are not implemented.

The full source lives in the `DishLaundry` directory. See [`DishLaundry/README.md`](DishLaundry/README.md) for build instructions and details about the project layout.
